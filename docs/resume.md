**EXPERIENCE**

**DevOps Engineer** September 2022 - Present

GDSC Future Academy | Cairo, Egypt

I mentor and support individuals in the DSC community across Egypt as the DevOps Engineering Lead at GDSC Future Academy. I am enthusiastic about DevOps practices and have spent significant time studying and implementing them in various projects.

- Optimized deployment for several open source projects by implementing a cutting-edge [CI/CD](https://github.com/etahamad/book-read-react-app/commits/main) system with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.
- Created faster, smaller [Docker images](https://github.com/etahamad/django-weather-app/tree/wip-docker).

**Software Engineer** Dec 2019 - July 2021

POSP | Remotely, India

My responsibilities included developing and maintaining device sources and kernels, and creating a CI/CD pipeline that automated AOSP and kernel builds with Jenkins and GitHub Actions. I used Bash and Python scripting languages to develop this pipeline and implemented it using Jenkins pipelines.

- Merged the latest Linux kernel updates into our sources to keep them up-to-date for our users.
- Created a CI/CD pipeline that automated the build process of the Linux kernel.
    - Configured the pipeline to trigger a build whenever any commits are merged.
    - Utilized Telegram API to notify the team when the build was complete.
    - Automatically uploaded the build artifacts for testing.
- Optimized the infrastructure of the organization's Jenkins nodes.
    - Worked closely with team members to identify issues and implement solutions that improved the build process.
    - Utilized best practices to enhance the performance of Jenkins nodes, resulting in a 20% increase in build speed and reduced downtime by 30%.
